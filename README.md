# Django-todo-project

This project was part of a Django full stack course from Udemy, https://hhmi.udemy.com/course/django-3-make-websites-with-python-tutorial-beginner-learn-bootstrap/learn/lecture/17847942#overview

This is a django todo app requiring users to login, create, complete, and delete todo tasks.  
The majority of the codes are from the course.  I created the todo logo.
